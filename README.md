### ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, my name is Alex Scott
- Competent Python programmer looking for a job
- I worked at HP from 2021-2024 as an Automation Engineer in QA Testing against iOS, Android, Windows and Mac applications.
  - Cross-Platform Automation: Implemented UI functionality automation tests across iOS, Android, and Windows using Python, Appium, Selenium, Jenkins, and pytest. Reduced manual testing time by ~60%.
  - Global Onboarding and Training: Successfully onboarded and trained eight automation engineers from San Diego, India, Brazil, Romania, and Poland through HPâ€™s automation framework and repository.
  - Regression Reporting: Developed, maintained, and reported regression results for 1,200 test cases in the iOS HP Smart App, ensuring consistent quality.
  - Test Coverage Boost: By creating, maintaining, and reporting on 500 test cases, I increased test coverage for HPâ€™s internal Jarvis project (across iOS, Android, and Windows) by 800%.
